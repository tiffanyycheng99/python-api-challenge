### How's the weather up there? 
Preparing for the weather is key to planning the perfect vacation and we seek to provide you the answers!

In this challenge, we built a Weather API that pulls data from OpenWeatherMap and Google Places and helps users decide on the perfect vacation spot with heat map visualizations and relationship analysis using linear regression

## Part I - WeatherPy

A Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenWeatherMap API Python library and a create a representative model of weather across world cities using linear regression to draw conclusions between the relationship of weather and location.

## Part II - VacationPy

A Python script working with weather data from Part 1 to identify the cities and hotes around the world with the ideal weather condtiions as determined by the user. We use jupyter-gmaps and Google Places API to create a heat map to display the four determinant traits for the idea weather conditions:

* Tempature
* Humidity
* Cloudiness
* Wind Speed
